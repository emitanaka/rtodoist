# rtodoist

This is an interface to [Todoist](https://todoist.com) - the todo list manager via `R`. I wrote this primarily for my own sake so I can write custom queries, format the results the way I like, and write them to text files. This allows me to embed the search results into my desktop using `Geektool`.

## Installing

Package is still in early development but you can install the latest version using 'devtools'

```r
library(devtools)
install_github("rtodoist", "karthikram")
```
